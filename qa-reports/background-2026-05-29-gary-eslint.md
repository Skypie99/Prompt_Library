# QA Report — ESLint devDependency Gap Fix
**Date:** 2026-05-29
**Author:** Gary (QA Engineer)
**Mode:** BACKGROUND
**Branch:** `ci/eslint-setup-2026-05-29`
**Head SHA:** `e3e6d9b`
**Base SHA (main):** `7b39990`

## Diagnosis: Option B — ESLint simply missing from devDependencies

### Root Cause

`eslint.config.mjs` existed on `main` (merged via `a90ccb8`), `npm run lint` and `npm run lint:fix` scripts existed, but ESLint and all related packages were **not listed in `devDependencies`** and not in `package-lock.json`.

The previous work (`qa/eslint-prettier-2026-05-28`, commit `b059db0`) installed packages locally to `node_modules` during the session, but never committed the updated `package.json` devDependencies. The merge captured config files and auto-fixed source files, but not the dependency declarations.

Anyone who ran `npm ci` (as CI does) would get a missing-binary error on `npm run lint`.

### Second discovery: FlatCompat incompatibility with eslint-config-next v16

The existing `eslint.config.mjs` used `FlatCompat` to bridge `next/core-web-vitals` and `next/typescript` into ESLint 9 flat config. This approach worked for `eslint-config-next` v15. However, the installed version resolved to **v16.2.6**, which ships as a **native flat config array** — not a legacy config object.

Using `FlatCompat` with a native flat config caused:
```
TypeError: Converting circular structure to JSON
    --> starting at object with constructor 'Object'
    |     property 'configs' -> object with constructor 'Object'
    ...
    --- property 'react' closes the circle
```

Fix: rewrote `eslint.config.mjs` to import `eslint-config-next/core-web-vitals` and `eslint-config-next/typescript` directly as spread arrays. No `FlatCompat` needed.

## What Was Done

### Packages installed (devDependencies)

| Package | Version |
|---|---|
| `eslint` | ^9.39.4 |
| `eslint-config-next` | ^16.2.6 |
| `@eslint/eslintrc` | ^3.3.5 |
| `prettier` | ^3.8.3 |
| `eslint-plugin-prettier` | ^5.5.6 |
| `eslint-config-prettier` | ^10.1.8 |

### `eslint.config.mjs` rewritten

Old approach (broken with v16):
```js
import { FlatCompat } from "@eslint/eslintrc";
...compat.extends("next/core-web-vitals", "next/typescript")
```

New approach (v16 native flat config):
```js
import nextCoreWebVitals from "eslint-config-next/core-web-vitals";
import nextTypescript from "eslint-config-next/typescript";
...nextCoreWebVitals,
...nextTypescript,
```

Rules retained: `prettier/prettier: warn`, `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps: warn`,
`@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` with `_` prefix exception, `no-console: warn`.

### Auto-fix applied (Prettier only — style, safe)

22 source and test files had Prettier trailing-comma and formatting fixes auto-applied. No logic changes.

---

## Lint Results (after auto-fix)

**26 problems remain — 24 errors, 2 warnings — none auto-fixable without behavior risk.**

### New errors from eslint-config-next v16 (new rules not in v15)

| Rule | Count | Files | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` | 9 | CommandPalette.tsx (3), HomeClient.tsx (1), PromptDetail.tsx (1), RunHistory.tsx (3), SettingsModal.tsx (1) | New rule in v16. setState called synchronously inside useEffect body. React discourages this — can trigger cascading renders. NOT auto-fixable (behavior change required). |
| `react-hooks/purity` | 1 | RunHistory.tsx:166 | `Date.now()` inside `useMemo`. New rule. Requires moving the call outside `useMemo` or using `useRef`. NOT auto-fixable. |

### Carried-over errors (same as previous Gary ESLint report 2026-05-28)

| Rule | Count | Files |
|---|---|---|
| `@typescript-eslint/ban-ts-comment` | 12 errors | density.test.ts, library.test.ts, sort.test.ts, values.test.ts, integration-run-pipeline.test.ts, library-storage.test.ts, runs-extra.test.ts (all need descriptions on `@ts-expect-error`) |
| `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` | 2 warnings | transfer-extra.test.ts: `m` and `d` destructured but unused |

---

## Check Results

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `npm run typecheck` | PASS — 0 errors |
| `npm test` | PASS — 324/324 tests, 19 test files |
| `npm run lint` (binary exists) | PASS (binary resolves) |
| `npm run lint` (clean run) | FAIL — 26 non-auto-fixable errors remain |

The lint script now _runs_ correctly — previously it failed entirely with missing binary. The remaining 26 errors are pre-existing code quality issues surfaced by v16's stricter rules, not regressions introduced by this change.

---

## DECISIONS FOR SKY

### Merge ready? (recommendation: YES with caveats)

The gap is fixed — `npm ci && npm run lint` now works. The branch is safe to merge.

The 26 remaining lint errors are:
1. **`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` (9 errors)** — Real React anti-patterns. They won't crash the app but can cause unnecessary re-renders. Recommend a follow-up Shamus fix cycle targeting these 5 components.
2. **`react-hooks/purity` (1 error)** — `Date.now()` in `useMemo` in `RunHistory`. Easy fix: move `Date.now()` call into the `useMemo` deps or extract it to a ref.
3. **`@typescript-eslint/ban-ts-comment` (12 errors)** — Add descriptions to `@ts-expect-error` directives in test files. Cosmetic, no runtime risk.
4. **`@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` (2 warnings)** — Prefix `m` → `_m` and `d` → `_d` in transfer-extra.test.ts.

### Should CI run lint?

Currently `ci.yml` does NOT run `npm run lint` — only typecheck, test, and build. After this branch merges, recommend adding a lint step to CI. Note: lint will currently FAIL due to the 26 errors above. Recommend either:
- (a) Add `npm run lint -- --max-warnings 0` after fixing all 26 errors, OR
- (b) Add `npm run lint` to CI now (it exits 1 on errors, will flag new regressions while existing errors are visible but pre-known)

### No push / no merge performed — branch `ci/eslint-setup-2026-05-29` is local only.
